# A simple statistical analysis of “My 2020” playlist on Yandex.Music

I've made a data frame based on my own “My 2020” playist on Yandex.Music. The playlist is an *.ods file and includes: the ordinal numer of the song, the name of the song, the artist, release year, language and text of the song. An R script (Code.R) proceeds the data frame and draws some plots and a wordcloud. An Rmd file (Article.R) contains a description of the process and the results of the analysis written in a manner of a scientific article. In fact, it's not a scientific article but a (partially joke) blog post on habr.com.
